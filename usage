## Usage

The program will display instructions and prompts on the 16x2 LCD display connected to your Raspberry Pi. Here's a brief overview of the functionality:

1. Upon running the program, the LCD will display the welcome message and instructions to place the product inside the system.

2. Use button 1 to control motor 1. Pressing the button will rotate motor 1 to a predefined position. Pressing it again will rotate it back to the original position.

3. After the product is placed inside and button 1 is pressed, the LCD will display a "Thank you!" message.

4. The system is now ready to perform an RFID tag scan. Hold an RFID tag with the text "Hello" near the RFID reader.

5. If the scan is successful, the LCD will display a "Scan successful" message. Motor 2 will then move to a different position.

6. Use button 2 to control motor 2. Pressing the button will rotate motor 2 to a predefined position. Pressing it again will rotate it back to the original position.

7. After the successful tag scan and motor movement, the LCD will display a "Thank you!" message and an "Enjoy your product" message.

8. The system will then loop back to the initial state and continue the process.
